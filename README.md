## Overview ##

We've added support for the Http Module. This allows you to leverage your current investment in this, but leverage the power and flexibility that comes with the ReflectInsight viewer. You can view your Http messages in real-time, in a rich viewer that allows you to filter out and search for what really matters to you.

## Benefits of ReflectInsight Extensions ##

The benefits to using the Insight Extensions is that you can easily and quickly add them to your applicable with little effort and then use the ReflectInsight Viewer to view your logging in real-time, allowing you to filter, search, navigate and see the details of your logged messages.

## Getting Started

Coming soon...
